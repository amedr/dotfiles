# My dotfiles

## Installation

### Using Git

You may want to clone the repository to your home directory. The install.sh script will symlink the dotfiles to your home folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amedse/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./install.sh
```

## Notes

For VIM, it assumes that you will use [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) `.vimrc` files.
